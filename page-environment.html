  ü§ñ A company called Milrem Robotics has developed a robot capable of planting trees and covering a whole hectare in only 6.5 hours. This robot uses remote operation and waypoint navigation to intelligently follow preplanned routes with minimal human intervention. The company is currently developing a follow me mode where it can follow the operator using computer vision as well as a swarm mode where multiple robots can work together.

    üî• Researchers at Stanford University are using CAT scan technology to analyse how smouldering wood lights on fire. They hope to be able to apply their better understanding of this transition to computer models that will predict wildfires. These better models could then be used to strategically fight fires at the most critical points.

  ‚òÄÔ∏è A group of researchers at Penn State have used supercomputers to help find materials that could accelerate the breakdown of water into hydrogen and oxygen when exposed to light. They did this by running an algorithm through a database of all known and predicted materials (The Materials Project) to filter out those that theoretically have the desired properties. Initial calculations suggest that using these new materials hydrogen could be produced for only $1.60 to the $3.20 it takes to extract and refine gasoline, making hydrogen competitive with conventional fossil fuels.
