  üß† Over the course of the pandemic, mental health has risen to be an even more serious issue.
  Machine learning has been used to track how conversations surrounding mental health has changed during covid times and the results are concerning. A research team from MIT and Hardvard University has found that Reddit posts related to suicidality and loneliness has more than doubled in the past year.

  üëÇüèª The new PhonoGraft technology, co-owned by Harvard and Mass General Brigham, is a huge leap in the field of personalised medicine.
  The PhonoGraft is an implant designed to help repair damage to the eardrum. The goal is to  mitigate the pain, drainage, and hearing loss associated with ear drum perforations, which affect millions worldwide.
  The technology should hopefully be making its way into the ears of patients soon, as it has now entered commercial development.

  ü¶† Currently around 1 in 5 breast cancers are caught in the early stages, before they spread into the surrounding tissue.
  However, it cannot be predicted which of these "stage O" cancers are likely to spread after surgery, and which are likely to be cured.
  This has all changed thanks to research by the U-M Rogel Cancer Center which has developed a new diagnostic approach using artificial intelligence to determine with over 90% accuracy, which cancers are likely to spread after surgery.
  The computer looks for patterns that a human would not be able to detect in high-resolution images taken of patient tissue in order to come to a conclusion.
  With breast cancer affecting 1 in 7 UK females (<a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics/statistics-by-cancer-type/breast-cancer">https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics/statistics-by-cancer-type/breast-cancer</a>), this breakthrough will allow patients and doctors to decide on the best course of treatment, and will hopefully spare women from unnecessary mastectomies.
