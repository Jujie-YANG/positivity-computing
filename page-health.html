  🧠 Over the course of the pandemic, mental health has risen to be an even more serious issue.
  Machine learning has been used to track how conversations surrounding mental health has changed during covid times and the results are concerning. A research team from MIT and Hardvard University has found that Reddit posts related to suicidality and loneliness has more than doubled in the past year.

  👂🏻 The new PhonoGraft technology, co-owned by Harvard and Mass General Brigham, is a huge leap in the field of personalised medicine.
  The PhonoGraft is an implant designed to help repair damage to the eardrum. The goal is to  mitigate the pain, drainage, and hearing loss associated with ear drum perforations, which affect millions worldwide.
  The technology should hopefully be making its way into the ears of patients soon, as it has now entered commercial development.
