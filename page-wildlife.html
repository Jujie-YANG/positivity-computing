        Companies across the world are helping to maintain and restore the dwindling honey bee population. <i>Best Bees</i>, a Boston company, installs and maintains honey bee hives for a fee in both residential and commercial properties. They then harvest the honey produced and hand it back to the customer. If that wasn't enough, software inside the hive records data pertaining to the health and wellbeing of the hive and transmits it to Harvard and MIT, contributing to important research initiatives.
    </p>
    <p>
        Across the pond, Irish firm <i>Apis Protect</i> specialises in installing wireless sensors inside hives which are capable of transmitting the data to an online dashboard. This is viewable by beekeepers who can monitor their hives digitally, rather than manually. But it is possible to go further.
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>Beewise</i>, an Israeli firm, have created a solar powered structure capable of housing up to 24 separate hives. Called a "Beehome", the system can operate almost entirely automatically, not only monitoring the hives but also harvesting the honey.
    </p>
    <p>
        Much of the technology included here is reliant on AI and machine learning to crunch the numbers and interpret the returned sensor data, demonstrating the growing importance of this field.

        Currently, surveillance carried out by humans in aircraft is the best way to estimate the number of elephants in complicated landscapes. Scientists have developed deep learning technology capable of counting elephants in equally complicated landscapes via satellite footage. Not only is this a huge cost-saving venture, but could be adapted in the future to enable the counting of smaller animals. This would require greater resolution on satellite cameras, but this is still a huge step.

            University of Copenhagen (2021). Algorithm reveals the mysterious foraging habits of narwhals. [online] Available at: <a href="https://science.ku.dk/english/press/news/2021/algorithm-reveals-the-mysterious-foraging-habits-of-narwhals/">https://science.ku.dk/english/press/news/2021/algorithm-reveals-the-mysterious-foraging-habits-of-narwhals/</a> [Accessed 4 Nov. 2021].

        Narwhals are plagued by the same climate change induced pressures as the rest of the natural world. However, due to their arctic habitat they are notoriously difficult to track and study. Consequently, they are harder to protect.
    </p>
    <p>
        A partnership between the University of Copenhagen and the Greenland Institute of Natural Resources has seen artificial intelligence contribute to the solution. By combining scientist's existing technique of listening to the sounds produced by Narwhals during hunting with the collection of new movement data, AI could produce an algorithm to compare these data points. This would make it much simpler to track and understand Narwhals through movement.
