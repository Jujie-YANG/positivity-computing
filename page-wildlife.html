        Companies across the world are helping to maintain and restore the dwindling honey bee population. <i>Best Bees</i>, a Boston company, installs and maintains honey bee hives for a fee in both residential and commercial properties. They then harvest the honey produced and hand it back to the customer. If that wasn't enough, software inside the hive records data pertaining to the health and wellbeing of the hive and transmits it to Harvard and MIT, contributing to important research initiatives.
    </p>
    <p>
        Across the pond, Irish firm <i>Apis Protect</i> specialises in installing wireless sensors inside hives which are capable of transmitting the data to an online dashboard. This is viewable by beekeepers who can monitor their hives digitally, rather than manually. But it is possible to go further.
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>Beewise</i>, an Israeli firm, have created a solar powered structure capable of housing up to 24 separate hives. Called a "Beehome", the system can operate almost entirely automatically, not only monitoring the hives but also harvesting the honey.
    </p>
    <p>
        Much of the technology included here is reliant on AI and machine learning to crunch the numbers and interpret the returned sensor data, demonstrating the growing importance of this field.
