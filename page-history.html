  üé® A group of researchers in Australia have been using machine learning to explore the history of rock art. By using multiple datasets with millions of images they were able to teach a model to distuinguish "more than 1000 different types of objects". Amazingly, based on the art style of the drawings, the model has had success in estimating when the art was drawn!

  üè∫ A group of archaeoloists has also been using machine learning to categorise historical artefacts. This saves them time and allows them to focus on making more exciting discoveries more quickly. This is another example of how machine learning can be used to quickly categorise objects in an intelligent human-like way.

  üìú Lastly a group of researchers from MIT‚Äôs Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory are working on a system that can help to translate languages lost to time. Their advanced system uses various language features and the predicatable ways in which languages change in order to work out preiously undeciphered texts. The fact that this technology is so quickly at a remarkably advanced stage suggestes that may be even more exciting developments to come!
